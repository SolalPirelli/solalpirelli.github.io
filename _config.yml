  summary: |-
     I did my PhD at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch) on automated software verification, making it more practical for [real-world code](/research/klint)
     and showing that verifiability helps [performance](/research/tinynf) and [safety](/research/tinynf-langs).  
     I also co-taught the [Software Engineering](https://github.com/sweng-epfl/public)
     and [Software Development Project](https://github.com/sweng-epfl/public/tree/main/project) courses.

     I spent a year at [Sonar](https://sonarsource.com) redesigning the dataflow bug detection engine to help developers find more complex bugs with fewer false positives.

     I also spend some of my free time on reproducibility and fraud detection in science, as you can see in my blog below.
