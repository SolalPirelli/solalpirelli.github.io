I co-taught EPFL's [Software Engineering](https://github.com/sweng-epfl/public) course,
and the associated [Software Development Project](https://github.com/sweng-epfl/public/tree/main/project) course.

I research automated verification of software, making it more practical for [real-world code](/research/klint)
and showing that verifiability is synonymous with [performance](/research/tinynf) and [safety](/research/tinynf-langs).

I also work on reproducibility and fraud detection in science, as you can see in my blog below.
